            <p>&emsp;The memory still persists and never fades, it always lingers and appears like a motion picture with cinematography filter applied to it. It isn’t black and white, more like the hue of the colors were off for several hexadecimal giving you the different shade of greens that will eventually derive the vibes of the 90s inside you. Except it wasn’t the 90s, it was in the middle of June 2001. The weather was supposed to be arid and the heat must have struck like hell, just like how it is now in 2018, but I can't recollect any of it, it appears to me that the weather was perfectly fine except that everything appeared to be a little bit gloomy and off-tuned. It was my first day of kindergarten and for as long as I remember, the idea of going to school gave me an overwhelming feeling of joyful excitement. I had always wanted to go to school because of seeing how the neighbor's kid went to school every day. But my mom told me that it was too early to go to school which led to my mom ending up teaching basic maths and how to read at home.</p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;The kindergarten wasn’t that far from home, it was like fifteen blocks away from home. It’s located near the bamboo forests – oh we used to have plenty of these in Indonesia, unfortunately, most of them are turned into residence now –  and people on TV always correlate the bamboo forests with creepy mystical creatures but this wasn’t the reason why I was terrified to go alone. I was afraid of the unfamiliar people and teachers in kindergarten. I have mom accompanied me only for the first week of kindergarten because by the end of the week I developed the courage to go alone and ended up accustomed to the new environment. Since then the route had become familiar to me that I could go to the kindergarten with both of my eyes closed, its right left right left and the bikers/car owners didn’t swarm as what it does nowadays. The route was so ordinary, it’s pretty much like any other suburbs in Indonesia, houses are closer to each other and between three or four blocks you’d likely to find abandoned house(s) – or houses that nobody bought in the first place – with wild bushes and mimosas growing around its surrounding  pretty much telling you that its control had been fully taken by mother nature.</p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;Fast forward to the start of January, my dad decided that we need to relocate to another house, he convinced us that it’d be a nice option to invest in housing and buy one for ourselves instead of renting the same house all over again since there were tons of new units built that year. The new residence wasn’t that far from the house we rented, it was just as far as the kindergarten I attended, so it took me twice as much time to go from home to the kindergarten. The only difference was the residence was so vacant that the serenity turned into horror. We were among the first three families that relocated to the residence, so it did make sense how one with felt so. As time went by, the route that used to be so unusual, transformed into something so ordinary to me. For an almost-6-year old Haries that would be the definition of the world to me. I meant, as a family, we used to go out once in a while, but anything besides the home—kindergarten route appeared to be too alien to me.</p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;Days passed faster than the rain dropped during Indonesian monsoon. It was June 2002 and My mom thought it was the time for me to leave the kindergarten because she felt that my age sufficed to go to elementary school. It was so wise and thoughtful of her since I knew it’d be a waste of money and time to spend another year in kindergarten. Like any other working families in Indonesia sending your kid to public elementary school would be a better option since at the end of the day, you’re not just going to pay the tuition but you have to pay for the shuttle bus and pocket money so your kids won’t starve or envy the things that their peers eat during break. Private schools might have far better facilities, cool labs and some even use English as the language of instruction, but the 6-year old me wasn’t aware of the difference between the two, all that I knew was they differ in their names and how far they are from the house. I meant even if I could have gone to one, the young me wouldn’t have been able to survive to live along with the privileged rich kids, the gaps are just too wide that I might have lost and drowned in the middle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;The elementary school I’d be attending wasn’t really that far from home, it was precisely located across my home but the river and bamboo forests in between them made it impossible to cross and looked like they’re separated miles away – funny how I had no idea about this until I entered 6th grade – and the only way to go there is to take the route with a bridge. It’d take around 15 minutes to go by the shuttle bus but since the huge bridge – that’s how I used to call it – and the road that connect my home and school were under construction that time, the shuttle bus had to take another route – the one with the available bridge – so it took around one hour to do so. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;The day has come, I was very eager for the first day of elementary school that I didn’t know how messy it’d have been. Together with my mom, I took the shuttle bus, I believed Dad wanted to come to but since he needed to go to work, it became just us two. In the shuttle bus, I saw some familiar faces, kids that went to the same kindergarten with me and those that I barely knew of. While the other kids played with each other, I didn’t, I couldn’t stop staring at the window because these routes seemed so novel to me, something that I never crossed. It was basically a sequence of bamboo forest, residence, bamboo forest, bridge, and bamboo forest all over again, but it excited me in an unusual way. The first few minutes the road wasn’t so crowded, you hardly see any vehicle in the vicinity, but once it entered the highway, it 180 degrees changed. It was so live. You could hear the roaring sounds of the cars and motorcycles. Something that you’re not going to find in suburbs. After a long ride, the bus stopped. There were so many kids in white-red uniform swarmed as they took off another shuttle bus, so I thought this might be the school and I was right as I saw a large board with the name of the school written on it. It was the first time that I landed my foot there, before this I never knew if there was school located across my house, before this I never knew if people live at this part of the city.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;The school was pretty big, around the corners Leucaenas grew tall, an indication that they might have been existing for decades and witnessing the come and go of the vast amount of students. Since it was the first day, the first graders with their parents were expected to gather in the school yard. It was spacious enough to accommodate everyone that came that day. Frankly speaking, I didn’t know if there’d be this many first graders but I had already heard that there’d be four different classes for the first graders ranging from A to D, with every class containing up to 40 students. </p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;When the pointer pointed exactly at seven o’clock the bell rang and pretty much everyone had already gathered, the yard now looked like the sea of tunas in white and red uniforms. The principal started its welcoming speech and followed by reading the list of names of people and the class they’d be going to. It took so long before it ended and my name didn’t even come up, I probably missed it and I started panicking. My panic intensified because I couldn’t find my mom and these people surrounding me were nothing I recognized of. I wandered and still couldn’t find my mom or anyone I knew of. After several minutes of searching, I cried. I was terrified of being left behind because I barely knew the route back to home. Fortunately, my crying was loud enough that it attracted the attention of the other parents – which again I didn’t know of. After being questioned and people tried to calm me down, someone finally found my mom. It turned out she was doing the administration stuff and she didn’t tell me where she was going. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>&emsp;That day I might not take the most significant leap in my life but it was an eye-opener, in a way that it successfully taught me how to unveil the curtains that had been covering the windows, keeping me away from seeing the world. In a way that I came to think that there are so many things out there wanting to be discovered, so many new roads wanting to be crossed and so many impossibilities lingering to be turned into possibilities. In a way that I realized the so-called ‘real’ adventure had just begun.</p>
